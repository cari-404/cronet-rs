> :warning: This crate is under active development and the API is not yet stable.

## Developers

First of all, clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sleeyax/cronet-rs.git
$ cd cronet-rs
```

Then, follow the steps to build the project:

1. Get the latest cronet binaries: [build from source](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/components/cronet/build_instructions.md) or download prebuilt binaries from [here](https://github.com/sleeyax/cronet-binaries/releases).
2. Place all `.h` header files in `src` and all binaries (`.so`, `.dll`, `.dylib`) in `bin`.
3. Run `cargo build`. This should trigger `bindgen` to (re)generate the bindings.
